### Update notes : 

1. Done

-> As a starting point, i'm still working on the maxforlive patch i've been working on last week. This time i'm testing ways to add one camera input per colors.

-> after testing, the cameara can only be open once and can not be used in multiple instruments. I need to find an other way to send midi to each instrument.

-> I will be trying to work on max msp only and use VST

-> I finally got it on max for live by changing the patch and distributing the midi channels properly.

-> It worked i have now a camera that play 3 different ableton synths based on rgb.

OPENING PROCESS reminder : Open loop midi (create from Max 1) -> open Max Msp Patch -> Open Ableton project (selecting from Max in midi chanel in)
