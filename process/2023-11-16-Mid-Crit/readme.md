### Personal feedback

I'm happy with how my project is evolving at the moment. 

What I need to refine to continue :

- how is the sound captation done ?
- how is the sound generated ?
- what type of sound / synths ?
- does the object project colors ?
- does Su√®tone move or is a fixed object ?
- kinetics ?
- Is it the tools only that create sounds or any drawing could ?

For now my energy level is about -42% my body require some sleep and a good animal crossing resting day to continue.

I ate a carac this lunch and it made me happy
