# During the hollydays 
---

The hollydays where great.

I've mostly worked on how I will be creating the sound between max-msp and Ableton.

I've also tested many sensor to know what would work best for color captation.

I've opted for a simpler way in the end. You can find all the code in the electronic folder.

(will be adding pictures of the arduino and captors connections soon)
