# Forms & textures

I'm aiming to get the for similar to the drawing objects and to create a cohesion between them and the robot.

### FORMS

### 01

for this one i'm inspiring myself from one of the drawing tools. (the rake like one) 

Keeping a simple box-like shape help associate it with the tools that are also squared/rectangular.

Adding an other wooden tone to the button could add to the envy to press it or to interact with it more clearly.

### 02

This shape is inspired by this picture of wooden stones.

As the tools and the process presented during 2023-11-16 presentation, where reminding of a zen garden and a calming process, this weirder shape could help carrying this idea.

I'm still not sure about the holes on this one as they seems weird and closer to a salt shaker than a rock.
