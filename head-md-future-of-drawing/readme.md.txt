# Bayblade inspired drawing bot Prototype

During this short project i picked up 4 cards to setup an idea.
-gyroscope-
-a bit too much-
-drawing game-
-notebook-

These words where the starting point to my research.

-> Gyroscope, inspired me the idea of using beyblades as a reference
-> a bit too much, was used as the main energy of the IA that is taling to you, inspired by old toys comercials.
-> drawing game was also linked to the dual batteling of the beyblades.
-> notebook, ... well i used on to draw on it so it count.

What came out of this little project was the idea of using body motion, 
especially the hands and arms, to be able to controle the robot.

User Journey for 1 player : 
-> attaching a bracelet 
-> turing on the robot
-> robot screems a you to encourage you to spin
-> if you stop spinning it will kindly screem at you to continue
-> after few secconds if you don't continue he will send you a prompt
-> the robot encourage you to continue his scribble based on the prompt
(idea is that you re still dizzy from spinning) 

The robot will encourage you to spin like a beyblade and will follow your movements. 

It has a pencil attached to it and will draw your movement.

The game need two players. The first one to stop spinning will lose.

# Presentation

first presentation of the key insight/paper prototype and scenarios.

-> I should have focused more about creating the user journey, i should focus more on it than the form.
-> Good feedback but i should define more the audio and sound aspect of my project as it was my first insight and my main focus.
-> The cube prototype is just a cube.

# Tutorials with Alexia and Douglas

Based on the presentation from yesterday, the sound is now a bit more defined.

First thought would be to create dialogue between peoples and the drawing bot.
Making a movement will create sounds -> the robot will then respond by copiying (or not) and creating a responsive sound.

Echo & Narcis -> Legend where Narcis repeat Echo's words by mirroring only the las words.

MAIN NEXT STEPS : 
-Testing with a bigger size, how to interact with it on the grounds.
-Testing the sound with real sounds (sampler or so ) OR with mimicing it with a cardboard sampler.
-Making a list of different behaviours ( different interaction categories)
-Creating an ABC of behaviours.
-Testing different volumes.
-Trying to know how much Script or Random is implicated into the experience.
-Testing 3 different Cubes colors to see how it affect our feelings towards it. ( Pastel, Grey, Flashy colors)
-Creating a user journey (can come a bit after).
