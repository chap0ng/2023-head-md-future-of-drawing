For the Caran d Ache presentation here's what i'll be using after all my test and the resolution to :

- not connect it via wifi for now.
- using a ready made bluetooth speaker.
- using a mini USB camera instead of the ESP 32 cam.
- Using the Arduino nano sense BLE 33, as it provide already everything i need.
- The battery i ordered is useless now as i've change my setup so the arduino will be powered also via usb.
- the Max-msp Code.
- The Ableton Live File.
