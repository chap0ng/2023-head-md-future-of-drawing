# Bayblade inspired drawing bot Prototype

During this short project i picked up 4 cards to setup an idea.
-gyroscope-
-a bit too much-
-drawing game-
-notebook-

These words where the starting point to my research.

-> Gyroscope, inspired me the idea of using beyblades as a reference
-> a bit too much, was used as the main energy of the IA that is taling to you, inspired by old toys comercials.
-> drawing game was also linked to the dual batteling of the beyblades.
-> notebook, ... well i used on to draw on it so it count.

What came out of this little project was the idea of using body motion, 
especially the hands and arms, to be able to controle the robot.

User Journey for 1 player : 
-> attaching a bracelet 
-> turing on the robot
-> robot screems a you to encourage you to spin
-> if you stop spinning it will kindly screem at you to continue
-> after few secconds if you don't continue he will send you a prompt
-> the robot encourage you to continue his scribble based on the prompt
(idea is that you re still dizzy from spinning) 

The robot will encourage you to spin like a beyblade and will follow your movements. 

It has a pencil attached to it and will draw your movement.

The game need two players. The first one to stop spinning will lose.
