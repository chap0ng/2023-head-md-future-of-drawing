### Pitch & User Scenario :

pitch : 

For my Caran d’Ache project, I’ve chosen to focus on the relationship between sound and drawing, utilizing body movement as the primary drawing tool. The robot would bring together the joy of drawing and the magic of generative music. It is aiming to create a discussion and collaboration between you and the robot, resulting in the creation of a unique drawing and a sound composition.
