# Wood prototype process 01
---
I started making the wooden prototype at HEAD - atelier bois.

1. We started by cutting the Pear wood and gluing it.

2. After it dried i used a "rabotteuse" to make sure i have the right dimensions.

3. now i have all my wooden block and i'm waiting to start drilling the biggest hole on Su√®tone.
