### Update notes : 

1. -> List of possible activation thought before prototyping.
![Activations-list](images/Activation-list.png)

---

2. -> grey box : 

- it got a crank to activate it.

- inspired by Caran d'Ache's pencil sharpner.

- crank it before every move (timer) or once (one time activation).

---

3. -> orange box :

- activation by pressing a button.

- will be tested in the same scenarios as the others.

---

4. -> white box :

- shaking it to activate.

- will be tested in the same scenarios as the others.

---

5. -> Added list of possible sound design to create so i'll be able to test it.

1 - Simple sinewave
