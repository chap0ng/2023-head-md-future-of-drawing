### Form feedbacks :

- The  Suètone form should be a bit smaller and  the paper where you draw need to be bigger so it harmonize the objects together.

- The drawing objects could be changed into stones like the suètone to create a general language and "mise en scène"

- For the drawing pencils : as they re not easy to draw with. I could use one of the two solutions to make it easier to use.
-> Making a recipient for water to use the capacity of "Prismalo" and make the drawing experience smoother
-> OR -> I could use "Craie grasse".

### Technical Feedbacks :

- the actual form invite the user to slide the object on paper.

- For the light I could use the playstation controler light as an inspiration. Blinking when connecting and keeping a stable light when connected or when the sound is generated.

- I could use the axiometer as a sound level input. Taking the robot up in the air lower the level and putting it down would make it louder.

- The sound level could be a trigger to play and stop the sound.
