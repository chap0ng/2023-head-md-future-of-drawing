#### As an other possibility for my project i was thinking of a fixed robot that record peoples movements and translate them into drawings and sounds.

inspired  by this project 

###### Francisco Sanchez - Seismoscopes

-recordings of the room vibrations made by visitors into a drawing.

3. -> 

### Tentatives/conclusions

4 testing situations where made with the box during the day.

For the first one i tried to create a Q&A style dialog between me and the robot. I make some movement, the robot answer by copying them and then producing a higher or lower pitch similar sound. This option is maybe the most basic one and maybe the most boring one too. But the video is quite interesting as a starting point for the user journey.

The seccond one focus on not having a motion captor attatched to your wrist. 



the third one



and the fourth one



Conclusion : 

Next Step :



4. -> done

5. ->
