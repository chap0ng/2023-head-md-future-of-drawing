# Tutorials with Alexia and Douglas

Based on the presentation from yesterday, the sound is now a bit more defined.

First thought would be to create dialogue between peoples and the drawing bot.
Making a movement will create sounds -> the robot will then respond by copiying (or not) and creating a responsive sound.

Echo & Narcis -> Legend where Narcis repeat Echo's words by mirroring only the las words.

# MAIN NEXT STEPS : 
-Testing with a bigger size, how to interact with it on the grounds.
-Testing the sound with real sounds (sampler or so ) OR with mimicing it with a cardboard sampler.
-Making a list of different behaviours ( different interaction categories)
-Creating an ABC of behaviours.
-Testing different volumes.
-Trying to know how much Script or Random is implicated into the experience.
-Testing 3 different Cubes colors to see how it affect our feelings towards it. ( Pastel, Grey, Flashy colors)
-Creating a user journey (can come a bit after).
