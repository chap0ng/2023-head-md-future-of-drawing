### V log :

As discussed with Douglas here's what I will be doing to continue prototyping and defining my forms.

---

### Electronics prototype :

##### Connection Schematic :

## Comming Soon ....

--- 
Camera : will be a 2 megapixel camera -> will be using a 240x240 resolution to start with on max msp.

---
### Core links :

Movement captor -> if moved -> light ring ON and camera Capture -> to Esp32 (first one) -> to Max/msp -> Midi or audio generation -> to Esp32 (seccond one that act as a bluetooth device) -> Sound Out

---

### Where will i be starting : 

### First prototype step :

I need to prototype with max/msp and my laptop camera to be able to have the patch ready. 

As the camera and sound are the core of the project, if this work then it will only need to be integrated in an ESP32/Arduino environement.

( The Esp32 part will be integrated afterward as they only act as send and receive devices. )

### Important note for the presentation :

I will not use AI during presentation but i will mention it and think of possible and usable API that could be integrated further in the project.
