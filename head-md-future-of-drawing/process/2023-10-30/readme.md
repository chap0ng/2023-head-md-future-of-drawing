# Presentation

first presentation of the key insight/paper prototype and scenarios.

-> I should have focused more about creating the user journey, i should focus more on it than the form.
-> Good feedback but i should define more the audio and sound aspect of my project as it was my first insight and my main focus.
-> The cube prototype is just a cube.
