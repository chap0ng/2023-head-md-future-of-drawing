# Preparing Presentation for 2023-11-13

---

### Today objectives :
1. Writing a “pitch” describing your project in 1000 characters or less. Stick to the basics: what, who, where, and how (i.e. interactions). Be specific in your choice of words.

2. A user journey or a scenario showing the key interaction (think from start to finish - show the whole experience)
 

3. Your key insights from your research (what are you basing your project on? Don’t just show other artists references, we want to see you own field research)
 

4. Your paper prototypes showing your design explorations. The focus should be on exploring possible interactions via multiple user tests. So don’t just show one prototype. More is better.
 

5. Pictures and/or videos of the user tests of your prototypes
 

6. Tentative conclusions. What are your next steps?
