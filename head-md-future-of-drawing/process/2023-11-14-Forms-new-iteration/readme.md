2 possible outcome : 

### 1. (the one pitche for 2023-11-12)

- You draw with hand movement
- the robot translate your movement into drawings

- 3 forms -> robot with attached pencil
- 3 ways of recording movement

### 2. (will be pitched the 2023-11-15)

- you draw with weird tools
- the robot read your drawing and translate it to sound

for tomorrow i choose option number two :

### 2. 
### Pitch :

For my Caran d’ Ache project, I’ve chosen to focus on the relationship between sound and drawing, utilizing body movement as the primary drawing tool. The robot would bring together the joy of drawing and the magic of generative music. It is aiming to create a discussion and collaboration between you and the robot, resulting in the creation of a unique drawing and a sound composition.

The robot would be designed for people of all ages, for art enthusiasts but also could be useful to musicians and illustrators.

It would have a four-axis rolling mechanism granting it freedom of movement on the surface he’s rolling on. 

Creating line with the given tools would grant the robot a musical partition that he will be reading to create sounds.

The AI is here to introduce different random behaviours to the robot. These would give it some freedom to make its own movement decisions or even compose its own music and make it act like an art collaborator.

I aim for the project to be exposed in a gallery, but it would require some space to make it work depending on the solution I choose. That is why, it could also integrate to any space that encourages free and expressive body movement. The drawing robot would adapt to your environment, turning your rooms into a musical canvas for your imagination.

### User Journey / Scenario : 

- Use one of the drawing tools to draw a composition.

- Start up the robot by placing it on your paper sheet and pressing the button on top.

- Listen to your creation.
